# SearXNG Search Agent

This project demonstrates a Google ADK Agent that uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to perform web searches via a **SearXNG** instance.

## What this code does

1. **Agent Definition (`searxng_search_agent/agent.py`)**:

   - Defines an AI agent using the `google-adk` library.
   - The agent is powered by a `LiteLlm` configuration, enabling it to connect to a local LLM service (e.g., Ollama) at `http://localhost:11434/v1`.
   - It is configured with an **MCP Toolset** that connects to a local MCP server.
2. **MCP Server (`searxng_mcp/server.py`)**:

   - Implements a FastMCP server that exposes a `search` tool.
   - This server runs as a subprocess controlled by the agent.
3. **SearXNG Connector (`searxng_mcp/connector.py`)**:

   - Handles the HTTP communication with a SearXNG search engine instance.
   - By default, it attempts to connect to `http://localhost:32768`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the agent, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python Environment**: The project uses `uv` for dependency management.
2. **SearXNG Instance**: You need a running instance of [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/).
   - **Important**: The default configuration expects SearXNG to be running at **`http://localhost:32768`**.
   - If your instance is on a different port (e.g., 8080), open `searxng_mcp/connector.py` and update the `base_url` in the `__init__` method.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure your virtual environment is synced:

   ```bash
   uv sync --prerelease=allow
   ```
2. **Start the Agent**:
   Use the ADK CLI to start the web interface:

   ```bash
   adk web
   ```
   *(Or `uv run adk web` if adk is not in your global path)*
3. **Use the Agent**:

   - Open your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev-ui/`).
   - Select the agent (e.g., `searngx_search_agent`) if prompted.
   - Enter a query like: *"Find the latest release notes for Python."*
   - The agent will use the MCP tool to query your SearXNG instance and summarize the results.
